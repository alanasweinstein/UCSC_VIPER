Docker for UCSC-VIPER wrapper README
Creator: Evan Paull <evanpaull@gmail.com>
Version: 1.0

This directory includes the Docker buildfiles to wrap several of the scripts in UCSC_VIPER/bin. You'll need to install
and learn about Docker first, then within an docker environment:

$ cd build_ucsc-viper 
$ docker build -t ucsc-viper . 

Will get you a docker image of the script. You can see the image you've built with 

$ docker images

After that you'll be able to run the test scripts in this director for an example of how to
run each docker container.
